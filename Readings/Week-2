## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science:
- 'interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets'
- 'incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, complex systems, communication and business'
- interesting thought: is data science distinct from statistics? voices of yes and no!
- now data science is perceived as an independent discipline
- fun fact: 'still no consensus on the definition of data science'

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub
- commonly used to host open-source projects
- 'GitHub offers unlimited private repositories to all plans, including free accounts, but allowed only up to three collaborators per repository for free.' -> might have an impact on work!
- subsidiary of Microsoft

## Bryan J. (2017) Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control? PeerJ Preprints 5:e3159v2
- Git is a version control system
- 'Git manages the evolution of a set of files - called a repository or repo - in a sane,  highly structured way'
- Git is used 'to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which consist of data,  gures, reports, and, yes, source code'
- 'GitHub complements Git by providing a slick user interface and distribution mechanism for Git repositories'
- 'Git is the software you will use locally to record changes to a set of files'
- for new or existing projects: dedicate a local directory/folder to it; make it an RStudio Project; make it a Git repository
- repository (repo): a directory of  les that Git manages holistically
- commit: 'functions like a snapshot of all the files in the repo, at a specifc moment'
- diff: The set of differences between version (A) of a file and a modified version (B)
- /also some information on Markdown and types of documents that sgould be used in git (e.g. md, Rmd, csv, tsv); go to text for more info/
- merge conflict: when git doesn't know how to jointly apply the diffs from two di erent commits to their common parent
- advice: use conventional file extensions and use internal links

## R for Data Science Chapter 4 Workflow
- alt + '-' gives a ' <- ' (shortcut)
- Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .
- Use TAB to get suggestions for objects / functions
- The + tells you that R is waiting for more input; press ESCAPE if you want to abort the expression
- by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, R also prints its value automatically

## R for Data Science Chapter 27 Markdown
- YAML header should be surrounded by ---
- Chunks of R code should be surrounded by ```
- Chunks can be given an optional name: ```{r by-name}
- echo = FALSE prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who don’t want to see the underlying R code.
- include = FALSE runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. Use this for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report
- some global options given (check the text: 27.4.5)
- 27.4.6. inline code! nice to use to present results/variables in text and not put numbers manually
- chekcing directory: 'getwd()'
